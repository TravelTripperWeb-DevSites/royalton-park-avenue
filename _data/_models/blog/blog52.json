Follow the footsteps of the glamorous foursome and feel like a New York gal for the day. The tour includes visits to the site of Carrie and Big&rsquo;s wedding rehearsal dinner, Magnolia Bakery for cupcakes, and Scout, the bar owned by Steve and Aidan, for some Cosmopolitans.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">No girls night out would be complete without the <a href=\"https://www.nycgo.com/events/mean-girls\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mean Girls Musical</a>.&nbsp;Based on the movie starring Lindsay Lohan, wear your best pink outfit and laugh as you remember why girls truly are tough.</p>\n<h3>If You&rsquo;re Looking for Classics</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.nycgo.com/restaurants/the-russian-tea-room\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Russian Tea Room</a> is an elegant and historic restaurant that has become a New York icon.

This gem plays in the opulent Majestic Theater, whose history is as rich and interesting as that of Christine and the disfigured musical genius that haunts her.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Before booking any of these experiences, consult the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">special hotel offers at the Royalton Park Avenue</a> and #FeelRoyal on your next <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/location/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">trip to New York</a>.</p>",
