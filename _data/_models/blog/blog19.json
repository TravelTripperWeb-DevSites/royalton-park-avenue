Snag a slice at some (or all!) of the best establishments the city has to offer.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Prince Street Pizza<br />27 Prince Street A</h4>\n<p><a href=\"http://princestpizzanewyork.com/\">Prince Street Pizza</a> serves up possibly the best square slice (ever). Take your pick of plain, Sicilian, grandma, or pepperoni. Meticulously cut, the pepperoni slices curl up ever-so-slightly on the sides, pooling a perfect amount of grease for a mouthful of flavor.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Joe &amp; Pat&rsquo;s<br />168 First Avenue</h4>\n<p>Originally founded in Staten Island, family-run pizzeria <a href=\"https://www.joeandpatsny.com/\">Joe &amp; Pat&rsquo;s</a> now has a sister shop in the East Village. Each savory slice is loaded with tangy sauce and&nbsp;gooey globs of mozzarella. Drop by on a Monday or Tuesday night and treat yourself to a large pie for just $10!</p>\n<h4>Denino&rsquo;s<br />93 Macdougal Street</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"http://deninosgreenwichvillage.com/menu.html\">Denino&rsquo;s</a> is all about the toppings. Their crunchy thin-crust pies are amply filled with anchovies, fresh garlic, sausage, bacon, eggplant, and more. Take a stab at the Garbage Pizza, dressed to the brim with sausage, meatballs, pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions. (Take our word for it &mdash; this hearty number is worth the calories.)</p>\n<h4>Lombardi&rsquo;s<br />32 Spring Street</h4>\n<p>One must pay homage to <a href=\"http://www.firstpizza.com/lombardishttp://www.firstpizza.com/lombardis\">Lombardi&rsquo;s</a> when seeking out &lsquo;za in the Big Apple. Licensed in 1905, it was the first-ever pizza shop opened in the United States. Gather the family and load up on their classic margarita and white pizzas, paired with salad and an ice-cold coke.</p>\n<h4>Joe&rsquo;s<br />150 E 14th Street</h4>\n<p>Coined the &ldquo;quintessential New York slice&rdquo; by New York Magazine, <a href=\"http://www.joespizzanyc.com/\">Joe&rsquo;s</a> dishes out non-pretentious plain, Sicilian, and meat-topped pies. And the best part? Each location is open until 4:00AM to satisfy any late-night cravings. (14th Street is closest to Royalton Park Avenue.)</p>",
