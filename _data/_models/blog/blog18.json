  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">In true NY fashion, winter seems to melt right into summer, with sunny days, warm temperatures, and everyone looking for a spot in the shade. Want to beat the summer heat but still take in the sunshine? If you&rsquo;re staying with us at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/\">Royalton Park Avenue</a> in Midtown Manhattan, we have a few options for you to keep cool during the summer months. Our rooftop is the perfect place to relax and sunbathe during the day, with most evenings featuring live entertainment, from Monday jazz nights to poolside DJs and live music Weds-Sundays.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Take a Dip in the Pool</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We don&rsquo;t mean to brag, but a rooftop pool in Manhattan is something to be desired and our overnight guests have full access. Take in the outstanding views of the city while relaxing poolside. Feel free to lounge about near the pool while enjoying a cold drink from our bar, which brings us to the next option&hellip;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Have a Drink</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All the summer sunshine calls for a cold drink of some kind, and our rooftop bar specializes in frozen drinks and specialty cocktails that will keep you cool. Let us recommend the fruity Lady in Pink, a rum cocktail dressed in strawberry, pineapple and fresh lime juice, perfect for hot summer days. Or, opt for a Royalton Pimms Cup, fixed with Bulldog gin, Pimms, fresh ginger, lemon juice and club soda. This tart drink is refreshing and made for the season.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Get Vitamin D at Our Newly-Opened Sun Deck</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At the top of our tri-level rooftop is the newly-opened sun deck, which serves traditional and frozen drinks and a great selection of brews from our extended beer menu. The sun deck opens at 4 during the week so you can enjoy a softer sun and refreshing drink. The sun deck opens at noon on weekends.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><em>Planning a trip to NYC?
