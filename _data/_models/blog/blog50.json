Then, our clothes begin to feel considerably tighter, especially because we don&rsquo;t feel like working out. At all. Does this sound familiar? If the answer is yes, it&rsquo;s time to break the cycle. Read Royalton Park Avenue&rsquo;s recommendations for staying fit indoors this winter.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/exhale-fitness-spa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exhale Fitness Spa</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Located on the third floor of Royalton Park Avenue, Exhale is a studio offering superb fitness classes to suit every taste. Yogis can practice their inversions, arm balances or simple warrior poses with top teachers. If you want to try something different, why not book a barre class? This fitness trend is becoming more popular each day, as it combines the flexibility, strength training and grace that ballet dancers possess. Those looking for a high-intensity workout should sign up for a HIIT class &mdash; a fast-paced interval workout that will leave you dripping even on the coldest of days.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/fitness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Flywheel</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cyclists tend to experience withdrawal symptoms when snow starts falling. Apart from installing a bike trainer in your home, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do&hellip; That is, unless you book a Flywheel class with us! &nbsp;Each class consists of energetic indoor cycling sessions that push your body to the limit. Practice riding up steep hills, speed along flat courses or experience mixed terrain. Whatever your fitness goal, Flywheel makes it possible.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><img id=\"1545256292689\" class=\" \" src=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/large_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" alt=\"couple-climbing-in-indoor-gym-at-chelsea-piers-nyc\" data-image-large=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/large_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" data-image-medium=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/medium_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" data-image-small=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/small_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" data-image-xsmall=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/xsmall_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" data-image-thumb=\"//cdn.traveltripper.io/site-assets/192_800_22150/media/2018-12-19-165019/thumb_royalton-park-avenue-indoor-fitness-options-nyc-chelsea-piers.jpg\" /><a href=\"https://www.chelseapiers.com/also-at-the-piers/drop-in/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chelsea Piers</a></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you haven&rsquo;t decided on what activity to take on this winter, Chelsea Piers is the answer to your prayers.
