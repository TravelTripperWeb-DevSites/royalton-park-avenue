  "long_description": "<p>The South Street Seaport has seen its share of history since the site&rsquo;s first pier opened in 1625. The seaport was occupied by the British during the American Revolutionary War and later put New York on the map as a world trade center. In more recent years it fell into a state of tacky, tourist stalls that locals avoided, but now the up-and-coming Seaport District is undergoing a renaissance of sorts.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This year the historic district has opened its doors to new shops, restaurants, and neighbors: <a href=\"http://www.espn.com/\">ESPN</a> just opened a NYC studio at the edge of the port this spring. The old, wooden pier and tired shopping plaza were torn down and replaced with <a href=\"https://www.pier17ny.com/\">Pier 17</a>, a mostly transparent 300,00- square-foot mall with a lush, green rooftop.</p>\n<p>Pier 17&rsquo;s Rooftop Concert Series just kicked off in July with a <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com/The-Rooftop-at-Pier-17-tickets-New-York/venue/237751?camefrom=CFC_PIER17NY_SDSITE#focus_event_table\">full lineup</a> set through October. Musical acts include Kings of Leon, Sting, and stand-up sets by NY-local <strong>Amy Schumer</strong> and Daily Show&rsquo;s <strong>Trevor Noah</strong>. Pier 17 also has a cinema club in the works for movie screenings to be enjoyed on the rooftop.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/blog/best-rooftops-summer-in-manhattan/\">[Discover the Best Views from these Amazing NYC rooftops]</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shops and restaurants are expected to open during the summer to fill out the district and draw both visitors and New Yorkers. The Amsterdam-based men&rsquo;s fashion brand <a href=\"https://www.scotch-soda.com/us/en/home\">Scotch &amp; Soda</a> opened this spring at 18 Fulton Street. <a href=\"https://www.seaportdistrict.nyc/content/hhc/seaportdistrict/en/things-to-do/to-eat/river-lounge.html\">River Lounge</a> has also recently opened its doors, offering a lounge-like outdoor atmosphere with views of the Brooklyn Bridge; perfect for whiling away a warm afternoon.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Summer pop-up <a href=\"https://www.seaportdistrict.nyc/content/hhc/seaportdistrict/en/things-to-do/to-eat/market-hall.html\">Market Hall</a> is open toward the north side of the pier with hand-crafted cocktails and grab-and-go food. For a full meal, <a href=\"https://www.vintage61.com/\">Vintage 61</a> opened in the spring; the sports bistro with a wine focus is&nbsp;set up to please everyone. Its stunning interiors, drink list and fresh, updated pub favorites ensure that the spot will see success.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"https://southstreetseaportmuseum.org/\">South Street Seaport Museum</a> is a neighborhood mainstay; visitors can learn about the area&rsquo;s history in terms of its impact as an essential port in establishing trade in the US. Tickets can be purchased at the museum on Fulton Street; the print shop on Water Street and tours of boats docked at Pier 16 are also included in admission. Be advised, the museum still isn&rsquo;t at full operation following damage caused by Hurricane Sandy.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/blog/best-brunch-spots-in-nyc/\">[Best Brunch Spots in New York City]</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Due to open later this year is <a href=\"http://www.10corsocomo.com/2016/12/new-york/\">10 Corso Como</a>, a stylish hotspot that originated in Milan. This marks 10 Corso Como&rsquo;s first opening in the US, which is super exciting for the Seaport District and New Yorkers. <a href=\"https://biggayicecream.com/\">Big Gay Ice Cream</a> is set to open this summer, and Chef David Chang&rsquo;s famed <a href=\"https://momofuku.com/\">Momofuku</a> restaurant is slated to open later this year, serving Korean-inspired food.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To read more on incoming tenants, check out the Downtown Express article on <a href=\"http://www.downtownexpress.com/2018/03/29/whats-on-deck-for-the-seaport-wave-of-2018-openings-marks-banner-year-for-nabe/\">expected 2018 openings</a> for the Seaport District.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>Planning a trip to NYC?
