  "long_description": "<p>If you&rsquo;re taking a trip to New York City this winter, you likely have your warm parka, boots and long johns packed. And while the basics are important, accessories (or lack thereof) can make or break your level of comfort during travel.</p>\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at the most functional accessories to pack for your <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/location/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">winter trip to NYC</a>.</p>\n<h3>1. Gloves with Touch Screen Fingers</h3>\n<p>You don&rsquo;t notice how much you use your phone until you&rsquo;re wearing winter gloves. Having to pull gloves on and off to respond to a text, look up directions or request a ride can be a pain. Luckily, many companies are now selling gloves equipped with <a href=\"https://www.thenorthface.com/shop/etip-gloves-nf0a3kpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">touch screen fingers</a>, so you can keep your hands warm and Instagram feed up-to-date.</p>\n<h3>2. Thermos</h3>\n<p>Bring a thermos to keep your coffee or tea warm, as well as transportable. Order your coffee to-go in a thermos, and place it in your bag or purse until you&rsquo;re ready to enjoy. This way, your hands are free and your beverage is hot while you go from one place to the next.</p>\n<h3>3. Foot warmers, hand warmers</h3>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve ever used foot or hand warmers in the winter, you&rsquo;ll know what a great difference they can make. Available from a pharmacy or camp store, these lightweight accessories are a game-changer when it comes to keeping warm and comfortable in the city. You may also consider checking out <a href=\"http://thermacell-heatedinsoles.com.au/product/heated-insoles-proflex/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heated insoles,</a> which come in handy if you&rsquo;re trying to pull off a look that heavy socks just won&rsquo;t allow.</p>\n<p>4. Cross-body purse</p>\n<p>A handbag won&rsquo;t cut it in the winter, as you&rsquo;ll want your hands warmly tucked into your coat pockets. Pack a cross-body purse so you&rsquo;re hands-free, and if it&rsquo;s leather, make sure it&rsquo;s water resistant. Rain, snow and moisture are all regular parts of winter in NY, so pack accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>5. Wool or acrylic socks</h3>\n<p>The only thing worse than damp feet caused by wet weather is damp feet caused by lack of air. Keep your feet warm and dry with wool or acrylic socks, which will allow your feet to breathe.</p>\n<h3>6. Lip balm</h3>\n<p>If you forget to pack lip balm, your local Duane Reade has you covered. Still, you won&rsquo;t want to be without it in NYC for too long.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Planning a trip to NYC?
