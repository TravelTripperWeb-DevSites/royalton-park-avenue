  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This year marks the 50th anniversary of the US Open Tennis Championships; its humble beginning in 1968 saw Arthur Ashe defeat Tom Okker to win the title &ndash; only to be ineligible to receive the $14,000 prize because of his rank in the US Army.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">At this year's US Open, first-place singles title winnings are at $3.8 million; Flushing Meadows will unveil its new Louis Armstrong Stadium with a retractable roof; and <a href=\"http://www.usopen.org/en_US/news/articles/2018-02-05/2018-02-05_nighttime_tennis_scheduled_for_new_louis_armstrong_stadium.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">night sessions</a> will be held for the first time in championship history.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Here are some tips to making the most of your US Open experience as the 2018 tennis Grand Slam comes to an end. Book your stay ahead of time at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Royalton Park Avenue Hotel</a>, a boutique hotel in Manhattan, and enjoy city nightlife and more during your stay.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tickets</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Because of the succession of rapid-fire wins, losses, and overall matches during the two-week event, scheduling can be tricky. Day 1 schedule will be released Aug. 24. Download the US Open Tennis app for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/us-open-tennis-championships/id327455869?mt=8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple</a> or <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ibm.events.android.usopen&amp;hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Android,</a> or check the daily schedule published nightly during the event on the <a href=\"http://www.usopen.org/en_US/scores/schedule/eventschedule.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">US Open website.</a> After that, there&rsquo;s no predicting when your favorite player will take the court, though superstars typically play at the mammoth Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Purchase tickets off <a href=\"https://www.ticketmaster.com/artist/807197?irgwc=1&amp;clickid=TaTW%253AVVOe29X1Ck1-fyniR4aUkjV%253AYTe9QPPUY0&amp;camefrom=CFC_BUYAT_253692&amp;impradid=253692&amp;REFERRAL_ID=tmfeedbuyat253692&amp;wt.mc_id=aff_BUYAT_253692&amp;utm_source=253692-US%2520Tennis%2520Conferences&amp;impradname=US%2520Tennis%2520Conferences&amp;utm_medium=affiliate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ticketmaster US Open</a>, or<a href=\"https://www.ticketexchangebyticketmaster.com/usta/resaleorder/us-open-tennis-tickets/event/901?eid=90&amp;tnowsessid=218027780%23c43d1b58-4b0e-4109-8ce3-fd6d162946d5&amp;email=&amp;ppc=TNowAff&amp;subid=&amp;impradid=253692&amp;affiliateReferral=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> US Open Ticket Exchange.</a> You can also try other reseller sites to see if any courtside tickets are available &ndash; try <a href=\"https://www.stubhub.com/2018-us-open-tennis-tickets/grouping/8307/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stubhub</a> or <a href=\"https://seatgeek.com/us-open-tennis-tickets\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SeatGeek.</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Additionally, don&rsquo;t shy away from matches held outside the gigantic Arthur Ashe Stadium. For one, seats aren&rsquo;t assigned in the outside courts, so if you arrive early you can grab a court-side spot. Arthur Ashe does draw big names, but assigned seats can make your experience of the game more distant than those on the smaller courts.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What to bring</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Backpacks aren&rsquo;t permitted, so pack light. It&rsquo;s recommended to wear layers as it&rsquo;s typically hot and sunny during the day and chilly at night. All-day rainouts are uncommon in the summer months of New York City, but if you&rsquo;ll feel more secure, pack a lightweight poncho. Bring a small bottle of sunscreen, sunglasses and a hat for daytime matches. See <a href=\"http://www.usopen.org/en_US/event_guide/a_z.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">prohibited items</a> on the US Open website.</p>\n<p>Bring along cash for quick food and refreshment purchases. ATMs are conveniently located throughout the premises.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How to get there</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just like scheduling, transportation can be tricky. Ride services like Uber or Lyft see price surges after game days let out and can be more of a headache than a convenience during this busy event.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Using the Subway 7 train is the most efficient and cost-effective mode of transportation. From <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Royalton Park Avenue Hotel</a>, head north on 5th Avenue about 20 minutes and take a left on 42nd Street. From there, take the 7 line from the 5th Avenue-Bryant Park Station. The stop for Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens is the 111th Street stop, which you follow a few blocks south until you reach the grounds. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/nu92oUZo3h52\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See full directions.</a> You can also opt for a cab or rideshare program from the Subway &ndash; it&rsquo;s just recommended to get out of the thick of it before ordering a ride.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, for schedule details, advice and more about this year&rsquo;s US Tennis Open, read <a href=\"http://www.roadto45tennis.com/a-serious-tennis-fans-tips-for-the-us-open-tickets-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Road to 4.5 Tennis blog</a> for a &ldquo;tennisaholic&rsquo;s&rdquo; take on the annual event.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning a trip to NYC?
