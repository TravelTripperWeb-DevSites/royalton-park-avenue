Warm daytime temps and comfortable nights open your options for what to wear &ndash; we suggest you take full advantage of your favorite cami before the year-end chill.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pack (or shop for) these clothes and accessories and be your best self while in Manhattan.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Footwear</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is a detail that should never be overlooked in New York City. Break out those sandals you&rsquo;ve been saving since winter. We suggest a sandal <a href=\"https://shop.nordstrom.com/s/steve-madden-cactus-sandal-women/4936858?siteid=ty8NUtOSnl0-s9Qe7BW4uZK0SoehFLjrBQ&amp;utm_source=rakuten&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=datafeed&amp;utm_contentWomen%3AShoes%3ASandals_Slides=&amp;utm_term=5577542&amp;utm_channel=affiliate_ret_p&amp;sp_source=rakuten&amp;sp_campaign=datafeed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">with a bit of a heel</a> to elevate your feet from the sidewalk. Or, consider a breathable sneaker like Nike Flyknits or low-top Converse that you can dress up or down. The best way to keep up in NYC is with a comfortable pair of shoes.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bottoms</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Shorts may be tempting, especially because the summer season goes by so quickly, but indoor AC temperatures in NY can be uncomfortably cold. Save your shorts for time at the park or daytime at the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/eat-and-drink/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Royalton rooftop</a> (and make sure to order <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/blog/nyc-manhattan-places-drink-frose/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">a fros&eacute;</a> to get that summertime feel). While in the city, opt for light denim jeans, flowy skirts, and of course, the summer dress. We especially love the <a href=\"https://www.freepeople.com/shop/chambray-butterflies-midi-dress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">midi dress from Free People</a> that you can wear with sneakers, sandals or heels, and be comfortable for any kind of day in the city.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tops</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To dress up your jeans but maintain a breathable, comfortable top, consider the <a href=\"https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/equipment-slim-signature-silk-shirt/product/0478992276022?prod_id=0478992276022&amp;site_refer=PAR_NARRATIV_SAKS\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">silk signature blouse from Equipment</a>, available at Saks Fifth Avenue. It&rsquo;s perfect for a lunch date, visit to a museum or a day out shopping. Wear a nice belt and tuck in lightweight knit t-shirts to heighten a totally casual look; also consider <a href=\"https://www.eileenfisher.com/organic-linen-multi-plaid-a-line-tunic-r7muj-t4384\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">linen shirts from Eileen Fisher</a> that will keep you cool and mobile.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Accessories</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let&rsquo;s get the obvious out of the way: Sunglasses. SPF. Sun hat (<a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-accessories/g19694689/best-bucket-hats-for-men/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bucket hats are back</a>). Air conditioning can be surprisingly frigid in some establishments, so bring a light cardigan or colorful scarf to keep warm in the artificially cool places.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning a trip to NYC?
