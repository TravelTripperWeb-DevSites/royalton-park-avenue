  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">It&rsquo;s that time of year &ndash; and in New York City, we take Halloween pretty seriously. Annual events range from a procession of macabre ghouls to a light-hearted jack-o-lantern flotilla in Central Park. See what&rsquo;s going on around Manhattan during your stay at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/offers/\">Royalton Park Avenue Hotel</a> this Halloween.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Village Halloween Parade</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This annual event is the largest of its kind, made up of 50,000 participants decked out in their Halloween best. Started in 1973 by puppeteer and mask maker Ralph Lee, creativity abounds at this nighttime parade! Celebrate Halloween night in Greenwich Village with roughly 2 million costumed parade spectators. See <a href=\"http://halloween-nyc.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">the official website</a> for details. Parade begins at Sixth Avenue and Spring Street&nbsp;and continues to 16th Street in Greenwich Village.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Halloween Extravaganza &amp; Procession of the Ghouls</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Held the Friday before Halloween, this annual event is dreadfully stunning. The venue &ndash; of all places &ndash; is the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, a colossal, gothic cathedral that&rsquo;s over a century old and the fifth-largest church in the world. Now that the setting has been established, imagine this: a silent horror film accompanied by live organ music, followed by a ghoul procession put on by a professional theater company. Two evening performances are planned for this delightfully creepy event. <a href=\"https://web.ovationtix.com/trs/pe/10317267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Purchase tickets direct here.</a> 1047 Amsterdam Ave., Manhattan</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Central Park Pumpkin Flotilla</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How often does life present you with the opportunity to enjoy a flotilla of jack-o-lanterns? In New York, anything is possible. The tradition of sending off carved pumpkins in the Harlem Meer in Central Park has been going on for over 20 years. Other hands-on activities for the fall holiday make for an all-inclusive, wholesome celebration. This year&rsquo;s launch is Oct. 28.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.centralparknyc.org/events/individual-events/halloween.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See event details.</a> The Harlem Meer is located at Central Park North and Fifth Avenue, Manhattan</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">&lsquo;Spirited&rsquo; Events at Merchant&rsquo;s House Museum</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Merchant&rsquo;s House Museum has gained a reputation for its morbid events around Halloween, and this year in no exception. The perfectly preserved, 19th-century house in the Bowery is the best setting for all things creepy. Performances last&nbsp;from&nbsp; October through early November and almost always sell out, so <a href=\"http://merchantshouse.org/calendar/reservations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">buy tickets in advance!</a>&nbsp;Funeral reenactments, ghost tours, songs from the crypt and post-mortem photo exhibits are planned for this season. <a href=\"http://merchantshouse.org/october2018/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">See the October schedule</a>. 29 E.
