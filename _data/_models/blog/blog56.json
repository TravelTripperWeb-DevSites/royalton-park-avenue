Choose from a variety of classes that include barre, yoga, cardio and HIIT. Classes start as early as 6am! If high-intensity indoor cycling is more up your alley, book a class at the &lt;a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/fitness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Royalton Park Avenue Flywheel studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;h3&gt;Nourish your Body with a Spa Treatment&lt;/h3&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;Blustery wind and freezing temperatures aren&amp;rsquo;t kind to the skin.
