Choose from a variety of classes that include barre, yoga, cardio and HIIT. Classes start as early as 6am! If high-intensity indoor cycling is more up your alley, book a class at the <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/fitness/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Royalton Park Avenue Flywheel studio</a>.</p>\n<h3>Nourish your Body with a Spa Treatment</h3>\n<p>Blustery wind and freezing temperatures aren&rsquo;t kind to the skin.
