A taxi cab service is located right across the street from the train stop.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tour the fall foliage in Central Park</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you want to stick around the city to take in the season, fall colors are well within reach.

The mill serves hot dogs cooked in cider, which makes for a flavorful frank that isn&rsquo;t overwhelming.

The farm is set in the idyllic countryside of Chester, New Jersey, near the Hacklebarney State Park just over an hour outside of the city. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/ChgYAYfCrD92\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">104 State Park Rd.</a> Open Thursday-Sunday, 10 am to 5 pm.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2726e0b3-7fff-5c35-eb74-286559afbe7c\">Planning a trip to NYC this fall?
