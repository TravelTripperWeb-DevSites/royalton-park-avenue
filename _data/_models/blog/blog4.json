  "long_description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Spring in Manhattan can bring balmy weather with magnolia blooms in Central Park, but it can also bring snow and freezing rain. If you&rsquo;re planning a trip to NYC this spring, the secret is to pack clothes that you can layer. Whether it&rsquo;s warmer or cooler than expected, you can mix and match to create the perfect outfit to suit the climate.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let&rsquo;s take a look at what to bring along to Manhattan this spring during your stay at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/\">Royalton Park Avenue Hotel</a>, guided by <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/g16671735/new-york-fashion-week-fall-2018-street-style/?slide=14\">NY Fashion Week Spring</a> street style, from plaid boots to crop tops.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Footwear</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New Yorkers are on their feet a lot, and while heels look great, they aren&rsquo;t always a viable option for your daily plans. We suggest you pack a sleek pair of boots (Western-style boots are big this season) to protect your feet from the elements; sophisticated sandals from <a href=\"https://pikolinos.com\">Pikolinos</a> work as casual footwear and can be dressed up with dark denim; and, of course, a comfortable pair or walking shoes. The website <a href=\"https://www.whowhatwear.com/shoe-trends-spring-2018--5a676b02db2ae/slide5\">Who What Wear</a> makes a great list of the best Spring 2018 footwear fashions; lavender is definitely in, whether it&rsquo;s Nike running shoes or lam&eacute; sandals.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jeans</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A lot of our guests at <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/\">Royalton Park Ave</a> visit to shop or check out local concerts and events. The always versatile, sexy dark denim is the jean of choice this season and works great with all your vacation plans. Luckily, dark denim matches well with just about anything and can be dressed up or down. Keep an eye out for fringe shirts, which will make a nice contrast with your dark jeans. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with a nice pair of sleek denims while traveling, appropriate for just about any occasion.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Tops/Dresses</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If there&rsquo;s one thing NYC Fashion Week made clear for women&rsquo;s wear daily this spring is that bold, saturated colors are in. <a href=\"http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/gallery/the-5-biggest-spring-2018-fashion-trends-from-new-york-fashion-week-10989352/#!4/saturation-anoraks-four-split\">Featured dresses or crop tops</a> from <a href=\"https://www.tomford.com/\">Tom Ford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marcjacobs.com/\">Marc Jacobs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sachinandbabi.com/\">Sachin &amp; Babi</a> featured nearly-neon monochromatic colors, just about as vibrant as the daffodils poking their heads out in Central Park. Florals are also in, as well as <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/photography/g9622257/mod-inspired-spring-fashion/\">art-infused prints</a> and plaid. The &lsquo;90s are back!</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jackets</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As for jackets, it can be rainy this time of year in the city. Luckily, plastic anoraks, windbreakers and parkas <a href=\"http://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-features/gallery/the-5-biggest-spring-2018-fashion-trends-from-new-york-fashion-week-10989352/#!2/anoraks-four-split\">are making their comeback</a> from the &lsquo;90s this spring, with prints and bright colors. Check out styles by Calvin Klein and Claudia Li and <a href=\"https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g19549428/cute-rainy-day-outfit-ideas/\">Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar Guide</a> to beat the April showers in style. Also, wear your faux fur jackets while you can -- summer is just around the corner and you won&rsquo;t get to live your your faux fantasy for another six months.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bags</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sleek, small backpacks are accommodating while you&rsquo;re on-the-go, especially in the city. You can pack everything you need for the day and distribute the weight evenly. Check out the <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/cute-backpacks\">Refinery 29 guide</a> to the best backpacks to bring in place of a purse -- from inexpensive options at retail stores like <a href=\"https://shop.mango.com/us/women\">Mango</a> to more sophisticated, upscale bags from <a href=\"https://www.senreve.com/\">Senreve</a>.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><em>Planning a trip to NYC?
