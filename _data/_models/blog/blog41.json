Their merlots and chardonnays are exquisite, but where Bedell really shines is in their wine blends. Visit the old barn and open-air tasting area, that blossoms with hydrangeas in the warmer months. During wintertime, guests can enjoy a warm fireplace indoors while sipping on some of the region&rsquo;s finest.<br />36225 Rte. 52, Cutchogue&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">W&ouml;lffer Estate</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reds, whites, cider, and even gin. This Sagaponack estate has won significant accolades in the wine world. Tour the beautiful facility or enjoy nibbles and wine on the open-air deck that overlooks a seemingly endless vineyard.<br />139 Sagg Rd., Sagaponack</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wine comes secondary to the lively atmosphere at Baiting Hollow. Complete with live entertainment on the weekends, the farm is open year-round and has a spacious designated drinking area near the vineyard. It&rsquo;s also notably home to <a href=\"https://www.baitinghollowfarmvineyard.com/rescue-horses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rescue horses</a>, which guests can visit in their paddocks. Best of all, a portion of select wine sales goes to maintaining the horse sanctuary.<br />2114 Sound Ave., Calverton&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Bridge Lane</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This place isn&rsquo;t for wine snobs. Bridge Lane wine is produced by the well-established Lieb Cellars in North Fork, but they approach wine in a whole new manner. Producing fruit-forward varietals that aren&rsquo;t oak-heavy or particularly old school, wines are sold in bottles, boxes, cans and <a href=\"http://bridgelanewine.com/kegs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kegs</a> with brightly designed labels. For something fruity, untraditional and undeniably hip, visit the small tasting room and consider bringing home a box of wine (or a keg if you&rsquo;re planning a party).<br />35 Cox Neck Rd., Mattituck</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Jamesport Vineyards</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The delicious wine at Jamesport Vineyards is only enhanced by a cozy tasting room and hot Neapolitan pizza, fresh from their wood-fired oven. This vineyard has been around since 1986, making it one of the more experienced in the region &ndash; and it shows. Try the pinot noir or merlot for a well-rounded, fruit-forward glass of wine. <br />1216 Main Road, Rte. 25, Jamesport</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning a trip to NYC?
