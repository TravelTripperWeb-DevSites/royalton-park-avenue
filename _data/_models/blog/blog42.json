Visit these five art museums while in New York City, all located near <a href=\"https://www.royaltonparkavenue.com/gallery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Royalton Park Avenue</a> in the NoMad District.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">MoMa</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Seeing Van Gogh&rsquo;s The Starry Night at the <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Museum of Modern Art</a> is worth admission alone, but other masterpieces &ndash; such as Andrew Wyeth&rsquo;s Christina&rsquo;s World &ndash; makes for a rather moving trip to the art museum. Explore 200,000 works of modern and contemporary art spread throughout the museum&rsquo;s six floors. If you&rsquo;re looking for something a little more modern, the MoMa hosts attractive exhibitions, film series, performance art and events on the regular. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/6PWtbyyGs5k\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">11 W. 53rd Ave., Midtown</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">New Museum</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is where the cool kids go. The <a href=\"https://www.newmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">New Museum</a> sets itself apart from the MoMa because its modern art exhibits are almost all interactive. Kids and adults can be stimulated by playful exhibits. It&rsquo;s adventurous, undeniably hip, funny and provocative. Located at <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/W3QXXbyNenG2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">235 Bowery, Nolita</a>.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Whitney Museum of American Art</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Reflect on modern times, history, and history repeated at the Whitney, which showcases American art from the 20th and 21st centuries. Works from over 3,000 American contemporary artists are on display at this modernist museum, designed by Renzo Piano. The museum owns the entire estate of Edward Hopper and is widely-hailed for its beautiful curation and style. 99 Gansevoort St., West Village&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Museum of Arts &amp; Design</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;re into style and design, the <a href=\"https://madmuseum.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Museum of Arts &amp; Design</a> in Central Park is a must. The MAD is a relatively medium-sized museum that&rsquo;s often overlooked. It&rsquo;s well-curated with interactive audio installations, eclectic, off-the-wall art made with ordinary objects, ceramics, and attention to small details. It&rsquo;s off most tourist&rsquo;s radar and a comparatively mellow museum that doesn&rsquo;t take too long to explore. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/cSerRR1Gkty\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2 Columbus Circle, Upper West Side.</a></p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">The Met</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Founded in 1870, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Central Park is massive, its collection gargantuan, and its reputation enormous. In fact, if you frequently visit the city, consider chipping away at the Met&rsquo;s collections with each trip. See what you can of 5,000 years of art history at this magnificent museum in Central Park. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/RPwNS3whp3y\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1000 Fifth Ave., Central Park</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">--&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Planning a trip to Manhattan?
