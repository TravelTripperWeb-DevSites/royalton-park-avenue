Though most runners anticipate both the marathon and&nbsp;the celebrations afterward, sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to know what to do in the days leading up to the event.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">We&rsquo;re here to help! It&rsquo;s usually best to keep off your feet before a marathon, which can be a challenge in a city that involves so much walking. Here are some mostly-sedentary local activities to enjoy before the big day.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Load up on carbs</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Everyone&rsquo;s favorite pre-marathon regimen is eating!
