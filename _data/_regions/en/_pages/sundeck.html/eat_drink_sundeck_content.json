Great for soaking up some Vitamin D during the day and sipping a cool cocktail during the evening hours. The Sundeck serves up traditional and frozen drinks, like our classic Fros&eacute; cocktail, fresh coconuts from CoCo &amp; Co, an extended beer menu, as well as delicious caf&eacute; bites.</p>"
