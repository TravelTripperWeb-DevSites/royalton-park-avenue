Great for soaking up some Vitamin D during the day and sipping a cool cocktail during the evening hours. The Sundeck serves up traditional and frozen drinks, like our classic Fros&eacute; cocktail, an extended beer menu, as well as delicious caf&eacute; bites. Our High C menu is available on the weekends and offers a Savory or Sweet option with Champagne.</p>"
